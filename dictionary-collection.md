**[Folder Changelog](dict-changelog.md)**

Here is a folder containing all the dictionaries that I personally use and would recommend. I usually keep up to date with the latest versions of the dictionaries, and the folder is configured to automatically download and import the regularly updating dictionaries such as Jitendex, JMnedict, and KANJIDIC. If there is a dictionary in the folder that is outdated, please let me know!

Visit this repository for some stats/metadata on the listed dictionaries: [**Yomitan Dictionary Stats**](https://github.com/MarvNC/yomitan-dict-stats)

## What Dictionaries Should I Install?

If you're a beginner, I recommend following [Shoui's Yomichan Setup](https://learnjapanese.moe/yomichan/). I would say the _bare minimum_ is:

- Bilingual:
  - [Bilingual] jitendex-yomichan
  - [Bilingual] NEW 斎藤和英大辞典
  - [Bilingual] 新和英
- Grammar:
  - [Grammar] dojg-consolidated-v1_01
- Frequency:
  - [Freq] JPDB_2022-05-10T03_27_02.930Z
  - [Freq] Freq_CC100
- Monolingual but still useful for coverage to a beginner! If a word shows up in one of these dictionaries but not an English one, you can just google/MTL to find out more information.
  - [Mono] 実用日本語表現辞典
  - [Mono] デジタル大辞泉
  - [Mono Encyclopedia] Pixiv
- Kanji information
  - [Kanji] KANJIDIC_english
  - [Kanji] JPDB Kanji
- Pitch accent
  - [Pitch] 大辞泉

If you're a bit more familiar with the language, I highly recommend following [Kuri's Yomichan Setup](https://donkuri.github.io/learn-japanese/setup/#adding-dictionaries) which goes in depth with the technical setup process and recommends you install around thirty dictionaries, with a lot of thought having been put into the selections.

My personal recommendation is to install everything. With every dictionary installed, you know that any (actual) word you come across will almost certainly be in your Yomitan installation, and that you will have a good selection of definitions for almost any word. Most dictionaries on their own do not that high of a breadth of coverage so having less dictionaries installed means you may run into confusion when you fail to look up a word. Some of the dictionaries cover quite different subject areas as well - hover a cultural reference and you will be more likely to find it in the Pixiv dictionary than any other.
